This is my project in The Odin Project that is called Project: Recipes wherein I need to make a website that shows the recipes of a certain food that I like such as Kare-kare, Adobo, Sinigang, at Tinola.

In this project, I should demonstrates my skills in HTML such as table, list, and all the text-based functions.

I want to finish this project in the span of 2 days.
