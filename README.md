This is my project in The Odin Project that is called Project: Recipes, wherein I need to make a website that shows the recipes of certain foods that I like, such as Kare-kare, Adobo, Sinigang, at Tinola.

In this project, I should demonstrate my skills in HTML, such as table, list, and all the text-based functions.

I want to finish this project in the span of 2 days.
